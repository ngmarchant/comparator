\usage{
LCS(
  deletion = 1,
  insertion = 1,
  normalize = FALSE,
  similarity = FALSE,
  ignore_case = FALSE,
  use_bytes = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{deletion}{positive cost associated with deletion of a character
or sequence element. Defaults to unit cost.}

\item{insertion}{positive cost associated insertion of a character
or sequence element. Defaults to unit cost.}

\item{normalize}{a logical. If TRUE, distances are normalized to the
unit interval. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{similarity}{a logical. If TRUE, similarity scores are returned
instead of distances. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{ignore_case}{a logical. If TRUE, case is ignored when comparing
strings.}

\item{use_bytes}{a logical. If TRUE, strings are compared byte-by-byte
rather than character-by-character.}
}
\value{
A \code{LCS} instance is returned, which is an S4 class inheriting from
\code{\linkS4class{StringComparator}}.

\description{
The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) distance between two
strings/sequences \eqn{x} and \eqn{y} is the minimum cost of operations
(insertions and deletions) required to transform  \eqn{x} into \eqn{y}.
The LCS similarity is more commonly used, which can be interpreted as the
length of the longest subsequence common to \eqn{x} and \eqn{y}.
}
\details{
For simplicity we assume \code{x} and \code{y} are strings in this section,
however the comparator is also implemented for more general sequences.

An LCS similarity is returned if \code{similarity = TRUE}, which
is defined as
\deqn{\mathrm{sim}(x, y) = \frac{w_d |x| + w_i |y| - \mathrm{dist}(x, y)}{2},}{sim(x, y) = (w_d |x| + w_i |y| - dist(x, y))/2}
where \eqn{|x|}, \eqn{|y|} are the number of characters in \eqn{x} and
\eqn{y} respectively, \eqn{dist} is the LCS distance, \eqn{w_d}
is the cost of a deletion and \eqn{w_i} is the cost of an insertion.

Normalization of the LCS distance/similarity to the unit interval
is also supported by setting \code{normalize = TRUE}. The normalization approach
follows Yujian and Bo (2007), and ensures that the distance remains a metric
when the costs of insertion \eqn{w_i} and deletion \eqn{w_d} are equal.
The normalized distance \eqn{\mathrm{dist}_n}{dist_n} is defined as
\deqn{\mathrm{dist}_n(x, y) = \frac{2 \mathrm{dist}(x, y)}{w_d |x| + w_i |y| + \mathrm{dist}(x, y)},}{dist_n(x, y) = 2 * dist(x, y) / (w_d |x| + w_i |y| + dist(x, y)),}
and the normalized similarity \eqn{\mathrm{sim}_n}{sim_n} is defined as
\deqn{\mathrm{sim}_n(x, y) = 1 - \mathrm{dist}_n(x, y) = \frac{\mathrm{sim}(x, y)}{w_d |x| + w_i |y| - \mathrm{sim}(x, y)}.}{sim_n(x, y) = 1 - dist_n(x, y) = sim(x, y) / (w_d |x| + w_i |y| - sim(x, y)).}
}
\note{
If the costs of deletion and insertion are equal, this comparator is
symmetric in \eqn{x} and \eqn{y}. In addition, the normalized and
unnormalized distances satisfy the properties of a metric.

\examples{
## There are no common substrings of size 3 for the following example, 
## however there are two common substrings of size 2: "AC" and "BC". 
## Hence the LCS similarity is 2.
x <- "ABCDA"; y <- "BAC"
LCS(similarity = TRUE)(x, y)

## Levenshtein distance reduces to LCS distance when the cost of 
## substitution is high
x <- "ABC"; y <- "AAA"
LCS()(x, y) == Levenshtein(substitution = 100)(x, y)
