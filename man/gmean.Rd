\usage{
gmean(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An R object. Currently there are methods for numeric/logical
vectors and date, date-time and time interval objects. Complex vectors
are allowed for \code{trim = 0}, only.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}

\item{na.rm}{a logical value indicating whether \code{NA} values should be
stripped before the computation proceeds.}
}
\value{
The geometric mean of the values in \code{x} is computed, as a numeric
or complex vector of length one. If \code{x} is not logical (coerced to
numeric), numeric (including integer) or complex, \code{NA_real_} is returned,
with a warning.
